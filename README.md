# Project rename

To make it possible to import `github.com/xyproto/permissions` instead of the more cumbersome `github.com/xyproto/permissions2/v2`, this package and all further developent has been moved to:

### [https://github.com/xyproto/permissions](https://github.com/xyproto/permissions)

The `permissions2` repository will continue to exist like it is right now for backward compatibility with existing packages that imports `github.com/xyproto/permissions2/v2`, though.
